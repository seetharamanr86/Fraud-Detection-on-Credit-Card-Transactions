#### Executive summary
Per Nilson's report in 2022, payments industry in the United States is expected to incur $165 billion loss in the next 10 yrs due to fraudulent use of credit cards.
It can be largely reduced by building a more robust fraud detection system using machine learning models. 
This work aims to use some sample dataset, analyze the data, build few ML models, compare and suggest a best model suitable for this use case.

#### Rationale
There are a couple primary beneficiaries. The finance organizations (credit card companies, insurance companies) directly deal with this loss.
Innocent customers are impacted as well, where they lose their hard earned money.

#### Research Question
Identify and prevent fraud transactions in credit cards in realtime and thereby protect customers from losing money and help finance companies well serve their customers better.
Our focus will be on coming up with a machine learning model that can predict the fraud transaction accurately.

#### Data Sources
Will be using the dataset named 'Credit Card Transactions Fraud Detection Dataset' in Kaggle.
This is a simulated credit card transaction dataset containing legitimate and fraud transactions from the duration 1st Jan 2019 - 31st Dec 2020. 
It covers credit cards of 1000 customers doing transactions with a pool of 800 merchants.

#### Methodology
We will go through the following stages - Problem Identification, Dataset Selection, Data Cleaning, Exploratory Analysis, Statistical Analysis, Build Machine Learning Models, Evaluate/Compare Models.
We will use various classification techniques to arrive at a best model for fraud detection.

#### Results
Results based on the research are as follows.
KNN model provided better accuracy compared to other classification models used.

#### Next steps
This research includes some limitations. A better dataset can further help analyze the problem better.
Also, building a deployable model could be more practical. Additional efforts in creating packaged module,
parameter driven python function, with API and appropriate end point for easy access could make this model more useful.
